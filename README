Todo List App:

This is my first Android app in Kotlin language. Todo List is a simple app where user can add todo items to list, check it when it done and remove from list checked todo items.

Technical components:
Recycler View
Edit Text
Checkbox field
Add button
Delete button

Additional in Future:
All items added by user is saved only in list and when user close and open all items will be removed. In future I will add data to local database.

Link to apk file, video and screenshots of this app is below:
